Mainly thinking that I want to use some sort of puzzle box to create an onscreen image

* knob/dial (built over potentiometer) - brightens background
  * has to stay at a specific input to keep the background not too bright and not too dark
  * once it hits the right input, an led lights
* pressure sensor with blocks or putting jacks in - brings in parts of middle ground
  * each block or jack brings in different parts
  * once all are in, an led lights
* joystick - bring forground into frame
  * an led lights when correctly placed

* must be done in order
* maybe wrong order lights led a different color
  * green - success
  * red - wrong
